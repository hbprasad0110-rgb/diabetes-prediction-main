# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts diabetes risk using structured healthcare data and machine learning classification techniques. It demonstrates an end-to-end machine learning workflow including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and Kaggle leaderboard submission as part of the Diabetes Prediction Challenge.

## Project Highlights
- End-to-end machine learning pipeline
- Data preprocessing with feature scaling and categorical encoding
- Multiple classification models for comparison
- Model evaluation using standard classification metrics
- Kaggle competition participation and submission

## Dataset
- Source: Kaggle – Diabetes Prediction Dataset
- Type: Structured tabular healthcare data
- Target: Diabetes risk classification (Yes / No)

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Kaggle

## Workflow
1. Data cleaning and preprocessing
2. Feature scaling and encoding
3. Model training (Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM)
